# Nova
## About
> Nova was designed and developed mainly as a 'fun' project
  with the goal of creating a template engine that was fully
  written as JavaScript (not JSON), to compliment the current
  state some apps are at of "Client, Server, Database"
  using JavaScript.

> Nova will let you write templates with the full power of
  JavaScript and Node.JS, in a format your current IDE or
  editor already provides Syntax hilighting for!

> Almost every other template engine has some unique format
  to it, in which no-ones editor can provide syntax & highlighting
  support for. But Nova will be 100% pure JavaScript, letting your
  editor provide nice features such as syntax checking, syntax
  hilighting, code completion, source formatting,
  indentation settings etc.

> Nova does not conform to the current day ideology of what a
  template engine should or should not do. Node provides you the
  tools to do a job, and lets you do your job however you please.

Because Markdown seems pretty inconsistent with rendering between different implementations, I opted to write the documentation in HTML.

Please see readme.html instead -- I will link this to github pages when done.
