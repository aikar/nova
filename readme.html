      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Nova was designed and developed mainly as a 'fun' project
        with the goal of creating a template engine that was fully
        written as JavaScript (not JSON), to compliment the current
        state some apps are at of "Client, Server, Database"
        using JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nova will let you write templates with the full power of
        JavaScript and Node.JS, in a format your current IDE or
        editor already provides Syntax hilighting for!
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost every other template engine has some unique format
        to it, in which no-ones editor can provide syntax &amp; highlighting
        support for. But Nova will be 100% pure JavaScript, letting your
        editor provide nice features such as syntax checking, syntax
        hilighting, code completion, source formatting,
        indentation settings etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nova does not conform to the current day ideology of what a
        template engine should or should not do. Node provides you the
        tools to do a job, and lets you do your job however you please.
      </p>

        <h2>Initial Template Structure</h2>
        <p>
          A template file is treated almost in the same concept of an HTML/XML document, in that it
          should have ONE root node. In HTML this is usually always &lt;html&gt;.
          <br/>
          Nova uses (in the preffered syntax) a full JavaScript syntax based off of function calls, so a template looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre>

          html (
            head (
              title ('Hello')
            ),
            body (
              h1 ('Title'),
              p ('Page Content')
            )
          )
        </pre>
        <p>
          Nova also supports partial templates, so that means all partials must be wrapped in a container element.
          <br/>
          Every template is evaluated on compile time, and the last value returned
          at the end of the file is going to be the result of your template.<br/>
          Similar to how eval works. <br/><br/>
          So if you have the following:
        </p>

        <pre>

          html(
            head(
              title('Hello')
            )
          )

          h1()
        </pre>
        <p>
          Only the h1 is going to be returned, because you have 2 sections in your template.
          Only 1 root node may be at the end of your file, as that will be the result of the compile.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="doc.syntax">
        <h2>Nova Template Syntax</h2>
        <div id="doc.syntax.raw">
          <h3>Raw DOM Node (Object Form)</h3>
          You will likely never need to use this form of expression, however
          this is how nodes are represented in Nova and technically can be used.
        	<br />
          A DOM node in a Nova template is represented as an object, like so:
        	<br />
          <code>{html:[{args}, [childrennodes]</code>
        	<br />
          As you see here, It's a simple 1 property Object, who's value should be an array.
          Args and children nodes are optional, so a plain <code>{br:[]}</code> would render as <code><br/></code>
        	<br />
          If you do not pass an array as a value to the object key, Nova will guess as to what you intended.
          For example, `{div:{id:'foo'}}` is equivalent to `{div:[{id:'foo'}]}`
        	<br />
          And if you pass anything else other than an array as the value, that value is interpreted as a child node, for example:
          <code>{span:1}</code> would render as <code><span>1</span></code> and is equivalent to <code>{span:\[\[1]]}</code>
        	<br />
          Additionally, if a more than 1 value is passed to the array and the first is not an object (attributes), the array is treated as if it was the children nodes array.
        	<br />
          For example:
          <pre>{div:['Hello', 'to you sir!']}</pre>
        	<br />
          is equivalent to
          <pre>{div:[['Hello', 'to you sir!']]}</pre>
        	<br />
          Nova tries to make it as hard as possible for you to confuse it. Almost any syntax will work.
          The only exception is passing Nova syntax nodes to the array, since they are objects, so the
          following is <em>NOT</em> valid:
        	<br />
          <code>{div:[{span:'Hello'}]}</code>
        	<br />
          There is no way for Nova to know if you intended that to be an attribute or a child node, so you must use
        	<br />
          <code>{div:[[{span:'Hello'}]]}</code>
        </div>
        <div id="doc.syntax.walking">
          <h3>Walking a Template</h3>
          <p>
            Nova parses 1 node at a time, and can handle the following types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>HTML Tag Function or Raw DOM Node (Object Form)</h4>
              <p>
                Processed as stated above into HTML. Anything passed as a Child
                Node to the Node is then walked into and processed also.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Array</h4>
              <p>
                States that the array contains multiple nodes to process, and will
                process each item in the array.
              </p>
              <code>
                  span('Hi'),
                  [
                    span('Hi'),
                    span('Hi'),
                    span('Hi')
                  ],
                  span('Hi'),
              </code>
              <p>
                Is the same as:
              </p>
              <code>
                  span('Hi'),
                  span('Hi'),
                  span('Hi'),
                  span('Hi'),
                  span('Hi'),
              </code>

              <p>
                You will not usually directly use arrays in your
                template, but functions (described next) may return them
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Function</h4>
              <p>
                Any function in your template is executed ***AT COMPILE TIME!***
                The return value of the function will be then inserted into the
                template for compile.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may not ever need functions, but they are designed to help
                save you time in some places.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, a static list on a page could be built with a function
                which just iterates the list building the template syntax for it,
                instead of you typing the {li:'Data'} for every entry. And because
                this is done on compile time, this is fully cached to pure HTML and
                does not affect your template performance.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Anything Else</h4>
              <p>
                Anything else is considered to be a text block \(strings, integers, floats,
                booleans), and calls .toString on the element and adds it as a text block.
              </p>
              <p>HTML Entities such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; are replaced with entity tags.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>rawString(object)</h4>
              <p>
                One of the helpers <i>(described below)</i> is a rawString object. Text/strings
                in the template are expected to be just that, Text blocks for the page.
                And since strings are properly formatted with white space, that could
                cause you problems when you expect text to not be formatted.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need to add text that will not be formatted \(ie:
                passing your own HTML), then simply pass it the rawString helper:
              </p>
              <code>
                  div(
                     nova.rawString('&lt;script&gt;foo('),
                     nova.rawString(config.someVar),
                     nova.rawString(')&lt;/script&gt;')
                  )
              </code>
              <p>
                This will keep it all on 1 line. Again this is something you probably
                will not ever need, but it is there incase you do.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        Nova provides some utility functions for you to use in the nova variable

        <i>(refer to Initial Template Structure)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may call these anywhere you would normally be able to call a plain DOM Node

          All known HTML tags according to <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_reference.asp'
          target="_blank">W3Schools List</a> have a predefined helper function.
          so an &lt;a&gt; tag can be written as a() or more accurately, a({href:'url'}, 'Link Text').
        </p>
        <p>
          If I have missed a tag, please report it, but you can also add your own tags by calling

        <pre>require('nova').addHTMLTags(arrayOfTags)</pre>
        <p>
          where arrayOfTags is like ['fb', 'foo'], which will add an fb() and foo() tag for &lt;fb&gt; and &lt;foo&gt;

      <div id="doc.helpers.enhanced">
        <h3>Enhanced HTML Tags</h3>

          the UL and OL tags have been overloaded with Nova to assist in populating a list a little bit easier.

          <ol id="id">

            &lt;li&gt;4&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;5&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          And

          This is especially useful when processing the results of a function call or a renderVar.
        </p>

        <p>
          *nova.scriptSrc(function(){}, [var1, [var2 ...]])**
          If you need to include inline JavaScript on your page (such as tracking snippets) you
          may include the source of the script tag directly as a function instead of trying to build
          the string. You can write client side code directly into the template, but it will be copied
          directly to the client instead of ran server side.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also pass data that will be passed to the code on client side, like so:
        </p>
        <pre>

          On the view of the page the users browser would alert('Hello &lt;user&gt;! Welcome to &lt;sitetitle&gt;!')

        </p>
        <pre>

           &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
             (function(siteName, userName) {
               alert('Hello ' + userName + '! Welcome to ' + siteName + '!');

      <div class="sep"></div>
      <div id="doc.helpers.onrender">
        <h3>onRender</h3>
        <span>Declaration: <b>onRender(function(renderVars, render) { })</b></span>
        <p>
          onRender takes 1 argument, a function. This function will called any time
          your template is rendered. This is the bread and butter of Dynamic Content in your
          templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function, when called, is passed 2 parameters. The first being any local variables
          the business logic of your application has built in order to pass to the template.
          However, unlike other template engines, since Nova has he ability to render templates
          async, instead of returning the content in the function, you call the render function
          passing the content of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in other template engines your code may look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>

          span('Hello ', onRender(function(vars) {
            return vars.userName;
          }))
        </pre>
        <p>
          But in Nova, it's ran Async so you need to pass the result to a callback like so:
        </p>
        <pre>

          span('Hello ', onRender(function(vars, render) {
            render(vars.userName);
          }))
        </pre>
        <p>
          With this method, you could call some async operation which its callback can call render();
        </p>
        <pre>

          span('Hello ', onRender(function(vars, render) {
            some.asyncOp(vars.someValue, function(result) {
              render(result.someValue);
            });
          }))
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now note, even though its async, the visitor will not get the html
          (from the final callback on the call to .render()), until this op finishes.
          Other visitors templates can still render in this time though.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>***WARNING:***</b> I strongly encourage you to not use alot async operations
          in your templates, as under specific circumstances it could cause your template
          to render slower than it could have. A single async operation on a template
          render would generally have no impact to the speed of a page load, but
          multiple at different steps of a render could impact it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some ideas that would fix these specific slowdown conditions, and once its in place then
          async operations in a render would not hurt your performance at all, and this warning will be removed.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- end onRender -->
      <div class="sep"></div>
      <div id="doc.helpers.partial">
        <h3>partial / include</h3>
        <span>Declaration: <b>partial('filename'[, optionalArray])</b></span>
        <p>
          partial is a function that lets you include another template \(a partial template) into the current.
          Partials will be your main tool into seperating out the different aspects of a template.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partials may also be used inside onRender functions, so you can dynamically load partials
              \(ie: different page templates) on render.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partials also include support for an array as a second argument. If you pass an array, the
          partial is repeated for each element in the array, and the value of the entry in the array
          will override any onRender function inside the partial templates renderVars.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you include a partial with `nova.partial('partial', [{foo:'foo'}, {foo:'bar'}]);`
        </p>
        <p>
          And the partials source is:
        </p>
        <pre>

          span(partialVar('foo'))
        </pre>
        <p>
          and then you render the main template with `template.render('baz')`
          Then your resulting output will be
        </p>
        <pre>

          &lt;span&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          As you see since you passed 2 variables in the array to nova.partial, 2 copies of the
          template were rendered, and the onRender functions inside the template received the
          array values instead of the main onRender. However, if you still want to access the MAIN
          onRender vars instead of the values passed to `nova.partial`, they will be in the third
          variable of the render function:
        </p>
        <pre>
        nova.onRender(function(partialVars, render, renderVars) {
        </pre>
        <p>
          On non partial renders, the 3rd arg is essentially a duplicate of the first.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- end helpers.partial -->
      <div class="sep"></div>
      <div id="doc.helpers.rawstring">
        <h3>rawString</h3>
        <span>Declaration: <b>nova.rawString(string)</b></span>
        <p>
           This function is as described earlier in the documentation. It simply lets you pass a
           raw string to Nova that will not be formatted. Useful where you need unmodified data added
           to your template output.
        </p>
      </div> <!-- end helpers.rawString -->
    </div><!-- end documentation-->
    <div class="sep"></div>
    <div id="performance">
      <h1>Performance</h1>
      <p>
        Benchmarking has been done, and Nova will average under 1 millisecond per render,
        unless you use async operations in the template.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the ability to run async operations inside of your onRender blocks, its hard
        to say a definite answer to render time, and considering the number of onRender
        functions you use, and what things you do in the template can all affect the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But based on my own benchmarks, using a template that utilizes some of everything
        Nova can do, the average render time was 0.4ms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, it's pretty fast. Compared to other template engines, Nova is nowhere
        near the top, but I feel the speed it renders is 100% acceptable, and the features and
        style it provides are interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your application is slowing down, I'm going to find it really hard to believe that
        nanosecond optimizations are going to be your solution. In other words, Nova's
        performance is "More than enough".
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of those other fast engines are basic and do not give as much flexibility
        that Nova provides.
